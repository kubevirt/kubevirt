      summary: "Attach to a container"
      description: |
        Attach to a container to read its output or send it input. You can attach to the same container multiple times and you can reattach to containers that have been detached.

        Either the `stream` or `logs` parameter must be `true` for this endpoint to do anything.

        ### Hijacking

        This endpoint hijacks the HTTP connection to transport `stdin`, `stdout`, and `stderr` on the same socket.

        This is the response from the daemon for an attach request:

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 200 OK
        Content-Type: application/vnd.raw-stream

        [STREAM]
        ```

        After the headers and two new lines, the TCP connection can now be used for raw, bidirectional communication between the client and server.

        To hint potential proxies about connection hijacking, the Pouch client can also optionally send connection upgrade headers.

        For example, the client sends this request to upgrade the connection:

        ```
        POST /containers/16253994b7c4/attach?stream=1&stdout=1 HTTP/1.1
        Upgrade: tcp
        Connection: Upgrade
        ```

        The Pouch daemon will respond with a `101 UPGRADED` response, and will similarly follow with the raw stream:

        ```
        HTTP/1.1 101 UPGRADED
        Content-Type: application/vnd.raw-stream
        Connection: Upgrade
        Upgrade: tcp

        [STREAM]
        ```

        ### Stream format

        When the TTY setting is disabled in [`POST /containers/create`](#operation/ContainerCreate), the stream over the hijacked connected is multiplexed to separate out `stdout` and `stderr`. The stream consists of a series of frames, each containing a header and a payload.

        The header contains the information which the stream writes (`stdout` or `stderr`). It also contains the size of the associated frame encoded in the last four bytes (`uint32`).

        It is encoded on the first eight bytes like this:

        ```go
        header := [8]byte{STREAM_TYPE, 0, 0, 0, SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4}
        ```

        `STREAM_TYPE` can be:

        - 0: `stdin` (is written on `stdout`)
        - 1: `stdout`
        - 2: `stderr`

        `SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4` are the four bytes of the `uint32` size encoded as big endian.

        Following the header is the payload, which is the specified number of bytes of `STREAM_TYPE`.

        The simplest way to implement this protocol is the following:

        1. Read 8 bytes.
        2. Choose `stdout` or `stderr` depending on the first byte.
        3. Extract the frame size from the last four bytes.
        4. Read the extracted size and output it on the correct output.
        5. Goto 1.

        ### Stream format when using a TTY

        When the TTY setting is enabled in [`POST /containers/create`](#operation/ContainerCreate), the stream is not multiplexed. The data exchanged over the hijacked connection is simply the raw data from the process PTY and client's `stdin`.

      operationId: "ContainerAttach"
      produces:
        - "application/vnd.raw-stream"

            - `dangling=<boolean>` When set to `true` (or `1`), returns all
               volumes that are not in use by a container. When set to `false`
               (or `0`), only volumes that are in use by one or more
               containers are returned.
            - `driver=<volume-driver-name>` Matches volumes based on their driver.
            - `label=<key>` or `label=<key>:<value>` Matches volumes based on
               the presence of a `label` alone or a `label` and a value.
            - `name=<volume-name>` Matches all or part of a volume name.

          accept un-encrypted (HTTP) and/or untrusted (HTTPS with certificates
          from unknown CAs) communication.

          By default, local registries (`127.0.0.0/8`) are configured as
          insecure. All other registries are secure. Communicating with an
          insecure registry is not possible if the daemon assumes that registry
          is secure.

          This configuration override this behavior, insecure communication with
          registries whose resolved IP address is within the subnet described by
          the CIDR syntax.

          Registries can also be marked insecure by hostname. Those registries
          are listed under `IndexConfigs` and have their `Secure` field set to
          `false`.

          In Moby's API, HostConfig field in Container struct has following type

          In Pouch, we need to pick runtime field in HostConfig from daemon side to judge runtime type,
          So Pouch changes this type to be the complete HostConfig.
          Incompatibility exists, ATTENTION.

          Note that a running container can be _paused_. The `Running` and `Paused`
          booleans are not mutually exclusive:

          When pausing a container (on Linux), the cgroups freezer is used to suspend
          all processes in the container. Freezing the process requires the process to
          be running. As a result, paused containers are both `Running` _and_ `Paused`.
