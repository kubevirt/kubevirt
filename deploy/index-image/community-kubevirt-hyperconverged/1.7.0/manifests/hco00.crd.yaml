                                        or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this

                                        compatibility, both fields (DataSource and

                                        the other is non-empty. There are two important
                                        differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef:
                                        * While DataSource only allows two specific
                                        types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any
                                        non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                        objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                        values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves
                                        all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                        value is specified. (Alpha) Using this field
                                        requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate

                                        or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When this

                                        dynamic provisioner. This field will replace
                                        the functionality of the DataSource field
                                        and as such if both fields are non-empty,
                                        they must have the same value. For backwards
                                        compatibility, both fields (DataSource and
                                        DataSourceRef) will be set to the same value
                                        automatically if one of them is empty and
                                        the other is non-empty. There are two important
                                        differences between DataSource and DataSourceRef:
                                        * While DataSource only allows two specific
                                        types of objects, DataSourceRef allows any
                                        non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                        objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                        values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves
                                        all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                        value is specified. (Alpha) Using this field
                                        requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate
                                        to be enabled.'

                    type are discouraged because of difficulty describing its usage
                    when embedded in APIs. 1. Ignored fields.  It includes many fields
                    which are not generally honored.  For instance, ResourceVersion
                    and FieldPath are both very rarely valid in actual usage. 2. Invalid
                    usage help.  It is impossible to add specific help for individual
                    usage.  In most embedded usages, there are particular restrictions
                    like, "must refer only to types A and B" or "UID not honored"
                    or "name must be restricted". Those cannot be well described when
                    embedded. 3. Inconsistent validation.  Because the usages are
                    different, the validation rules are different by usage, which
                    makes it hard for users to predict what will happen. 4. The fields
                    are both imprecise and overly precise.  Kind is not a precise
                    mapping to a URL. This can produce ambiguity during interpretation
                    and require a REST mapping.  In most cases, the dependency is
                    on the group,resource tuple and the version of the actual struct
                    is irrelevant. 5. We cannot easily change it.  Because this type
                    is embedded in many locations, updates to this type will affect
                    numerous schemas.  Don''t make new APIs embed an underspecified
                    API type they do not control. Instead of using this type, create
                    a locally provided and used type that is well-focused on your
                    reference. For example, ServiceReferences for admission registration:
                    https://github.com/kubernetes/api/blob/release-1.17/admissionregistration/v1/types.go#L533

                        field access statement, such as desiredState.manifest.containers[2].
                        For example, if the object reference is to a container within
                        a pod, this would take on a value like: "spec.containers{name}"
                        (where "name" refers to the name of the container that triggered
