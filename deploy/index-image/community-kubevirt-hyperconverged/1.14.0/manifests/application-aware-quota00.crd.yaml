                                PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
                                API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                                preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                or until the termination grace period is reached.

                            RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                            This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                            For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                            the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                            Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                            this init container will be continually restarted on
                            exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                            containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                            will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                            is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                            container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                            for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                            container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                            init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                            completed.

                            StartupProbe indicates that the Pod has successfully initialized.
                            If specified, no other probes are executed until this completes successfully.
                            If this probe fails, the Pod will be restarted, just as if the livenessProbe failed.
                            This can be used to provide different probe parameters at the beginning of a Pod's lifecycle,
                            when it might take a long time to load data or warm a cache, than during steady-state operation.

                          description: |-
                            Key is the taint key that the toleration applies to. Empty means match all taint keys.
                            If the key is empty, operator must be Exists; this combination means to match all values and all keys.

                        operator:
                          description: |-
                            Operator represents a key's relationship to the value.
                            Valid operators are Exists and Equal. Defaults to Equal.
                            Exists is equivalent to wildcard for value, so that a pod can
                            tolerate all taints of a particular category.

                          description: |-
                            TolerationSeconds represents the period of time the toleration (which must be
                            of effect NoExecute, otherwise this field is ignored) tolerates the taint. By default,
                            it is not set, which means tolerate the taint forever (do not evict). Zero and
                            negative values will be treated as 0 (evict immediately) by the system.

                            Value is the taint value the toleration matches to.
                            If the operator is Exists, the value should be empty, otherwise just a regular string.
