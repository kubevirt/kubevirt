            providerID:
              description: ProviderID is the identification ID of the machine provided
                by the provider. This field must match the provider ID as seen on
                the node object corresponding to this machine. This field is required
                by higher level consumers of cluster-api. Example use case is cluster
                autoscaler with cluster-api as provider. Clean-up logic in the autoscaler
                compares machines to nodes to find out machines at provider which
                could not get registered as Kubernetes nodes. With cluster-api as
                a generic out-of-tree provider for autoscaler, this field is required
                by autoscaler to be able to have a provider view of the list of machines.
                Another list of nodes is queried from the k8s apiserver and then a
                comparison is done to find out unregistered machines and are marked
                for delete. This field will be set by the actuators and consumed by
                higher level entities like autoscaler that will be interfacing with
                cluster-api as generic provider.

                added to the Node on an ongoing basis by other entities. These taints
                should be actively reconciled e.g. if you ask the machine controller
                to apply a taint and then manually remove the taint the machine controller
                will put it back) but not have the machine controller remove any taints

                indicate that something is fundamentally wrong with the Machine's
                spec or the configuration of the controller, and that manual intervention
                is required. Examples of terminal errors would be invalid combinations
                of settings in the spec, values that are unsupported by the controller,
                or the responsible controller itself being critically misconfigured.  Any
                transient errors that occur during the reconciliation of Machines
                can be added as events to the Machine object and/or logged in the
