# Introduction

Let's start with the relationship between the two important components:

* **Kubernetes** is a container orchestration system, and is used to run
  containers on a cluster
* **KubeVirt** is an add-on which is installed on-top of Kubernetes, to be able
  to add basic virtualization functionality to Kubernetes.

KubeVirt is an add-on to Kubernetes, and they have several things in
common:

* Mostly written in golang
* Often related to distributed microservice architectures
* Declarative and Reactive (Operator pattern) approach

This short page shall help to get started with the projects and topics
surrounding them


## Contributing to KubeVirt

### Our workflow

Contributing to KubeVirt should be as simple as possible. Have a question? Want
to discuss something? Want to contribute something? Just open an
[Issue](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/issues), a [Pull
Request](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/pulls), or send a mail to our
[Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubevirt-dev).

If you spot a bug or want to change something pretty simple, just go
ahead and open an Issue and/or a Pull Request, including your changes
at [kubevirt/kubevirt](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt).

For bigger changes, please create a tracker Issue, describing what you want to
do. Then either as the first commit in a Pull Request, or as an independent
Pull Request, provide an **informal** design proposal of your intended changes.
The location for such proposals is
[/docs](docs/) in the KubeVirt
core repository. Make sure that all your Pull Requests link back to the
relevant Issues.

### Getting started

To make yourself comfortable with the code, you might want to work on some
Issues marked with one or more of the following labels:
[good-first-issue](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/labels/good-first-issue),
[help wanted](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/labels/help%20wanted)
or [kind/bug](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/labels/kind%2Fbug).
Any help is highly appreciated.

### Testing

**Untested features do not exist**. To ensure that what the code really works,
relevant flows should be covered via unit tests and functional tests. So when
thinking about a contribution, also think about testability. All tests can be
run local without the need of CI. Have a look at the
[Testing](docs/getting-started.md#testing)
section in the [Developer Guide](docs/getting-started.md).

### Contributor compliance with Developer Certificate Of Origin (DCO)

We require every contributor to certify that they are legally permitted to contribute to our project.
A contributor expresses this by consciously signing their commits, and by this act expressing that
they comply with the [Developer Certificate Of Origin](https://developercertificate.org/)

A signed commit is a commit where the commit message contains the following content:

```
Signed-off-by: John Doe <jdoe@example.org>
```

This can be done by adding [`--signoff`](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-commit#Documentation/git-commit.txt---signoff) to your git command line.

### Getting your code reviewed/merged

Maintainers are here to help you enabling your use-case in a reasonable amount
of time. The maintainers will try to review your code and give you productive
feedback in a reasonable amount of time. However, if you are blocked on a
review, or your Pull Request does not get the attention you think it deserves,
reach out for us via Comments in your Issues, or ping us on Slack
[#kubevirt-dev @ kubernetes.slack.com](https://kubernetes.slack.com/?redir=%2Farchives%2FC0163DT0R8X).

Maintainers are tracked in [OWNERS
files](https://github.com/kubernetes/test-infra/blob/f7e21a3c18f4f4bbc7ee170675ed53e4544a0632/prow/plugins/approve/approvers/README.md)
and will be assigned by Prow.

### Becoming a member

Contributors that frequently contribute to the project may ask to join the
kubevirt organization.

Please have a look at our [membership guidelines](https://github.com/kubevirt/community/tree/master/member_dd).
