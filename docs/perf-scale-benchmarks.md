### Benchmarks

This document shares some of the performance benchmarks observed as part of the v1 release.
It will talk about what this means for an end-user's perf and scale story.

#### Background: How to interpret the numbers?

KubeVirt is an extension for Kubernetes that includes a collection of custom resource definitions
(CRDs) served by kubevirt-apiserver. These CRDs are managed by controllers. Due to the distributed
nature of the system, understanding performance and scalability data becomes challenging without
taking specific assumptions into account. This section aims to provide clarity on those assumptions.

1. The data presented in the document is collected from `periodic-kubevirt-e2e-k8s-1.25-sig-performance` and after Sept
   06, 2023, data was collected `periodic-kubevirt-e2e-k8s-1.27-sig-performance`.
1. The test suite includes three tests:
   1. It creates 100 minimal VMIs, with a small pause of 100 ms between creation of 2 VMIs. The definition
      of minimal VMIs can be found [here](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/blob/20f6caaba4108733a2c3f216e3247202929c1ef9/tests/performance/density.go#L273).
      This is represented in the graphs as <Metric> for VMI, for example `vmiCreationToRunningSecondsP50` for VMI
   2. It creates 100 minimal VMs, with a small pause of 100 ms between creation of 2 VMIs. The definition
      of minimal VMs created can be found [here](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/blob/20f6caaba4108733a2c3f216e3247202929c1ef9/tests/performance/density.go#L219C1-L219C1).
      This is represented in the graphs as <Metric> for VM, for example `vmiCreationToRunningSecondsP50` for VM
   3. It creates VMs with instancetype and preference, the definition can be found [here](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/blob/20f6caaba4108733a2c3f216e3247202929c1ef9/tests/performance/density.go#L203).
      The benchmarks for this will be added in future releases.
1. The test waits for the VMIs to go into running state and collects a bunch of metrics
1. The collected metrics are categorized into two buckets, performance and scale
   1. Performance Metrics: This tells users how KubeVirt stack is performing. Examples include
      `vmiCreationToRunningSecondsP50` and `vmiCreationToRunningSecondsP95`. This helps users understand how KubeVirt 
       performance evolved over the releases; depending on the user deployment, the numbers will vary, because a real
       production workload could use other KubeVirt extension points like the device plugins, custom scheduler, 
       different version of kubelet etc. These numbers are just a guidance for how the KubeVirt codebase is performing 
       with minimal VMIs, provided all other variables(hardware, kubernetes version, cluster-size etc) remain the same.
   1. Scalability metrics: This helps users understand the KubeVirt scaling behaviors. Examples include, 
      `PATCH-pods-count` for VMI, `PATCH-virtualmachineinstances-count` for VMI and `UPDATE-virtualmachineinstances-count`
      for VMI. These metrics are measured on the client side to understand the load generated to apiserver by the 
      KubeVirt stack. This will help users and developers understand the cost of new features going into KubeVirt. It
      will also make end-users aware about the most expensive calls coming from KubeVirt in their deployment and 
      potentially act on it.  
1. The performance job is run 3 times a day and metrics are collected.
1. The blue dots on the graphs are individual measurements, and orange line is weekly average
1. The gray dotted line in the graph is March 1, 2023, denoting release of v0.60
1. The blue dotted line in the graph is July 6, 2023, denoting release of v1.0.0
1. The green dotted line in the graph is September 6, 2023, denoting change in k8s provider from v1.25 to v1.27
1. The red dotted line in the graph is December 26, 2023, denoting release of v1.1.0
