## Technical Overview

Kubernetes allows for extensions to its architecture via *custom resources*, which adds a new endpoint in the Kubernetes API that stores and retrieves a collection API objects of a certain kind. However, the *custom resources* by themselves only enable store and retrieve structured data. To add business logic and specific functionality into Kubernetes, it is necessary to use *custom controllers*, which are clients of the Kubernetes API-Server that typically read an object's `.spec`, possibly do things, and then update the object's `.status`.
You can find further details about *custom resources* in <https://Kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-Kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/>, and *controllers* in https://Kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-Kubernetes/

KubeVirt uses CRDs, *controllers* and other Kubernetes features, to represent and manage traditional virtual machines side by side with containers.

KubeVirt's primary CRD is the VirtualMachine (VM) resource, which contains a collection of VirtualMachineInstance (VMI) objects, which shares similarity with the Pod concept. A VMI represents a single virtualized workload that executes once until completion (i.e., powered off). In addition to the VMI, the key KubeVirt components are the virt-api, the virt-controller, the virt-handler, and the virt-launcher.


### Project Components

![KubeVirt components](components.png "Components")

 * **virt-api**: This component provides an HTTP RESTful entry-point to manage the virtual machines within the cluster. It is created by adding the KubeVirt's CRDs.
 * **virt-controller**: This component is a Kubernetes Operator that manages the state of each VMI within the Kubernetes cluster. When new VM objects are submitted to the Kubernetes API-Server, this controller takes notice and creates the pod in which the VM will run and delegates the other management operations to the *virt-handler* component.
 * **virt-handler**: This is a daemon that runs on each Kubernetes node. It is responsible for monitoring the state of VMIs according to Kubernetes and ensuring the corresponding libvirt domain is booted or halted accordingly. To perform these operations, the virt-handler signals and send the VM's CRD object to the *virt-launcher* component.
 * **virt-launcher**: This component is a place-holder, one per running VMI. It contains the running VMI and remains running as long as the VMI is defined. virt-launcher uses a local libvirtd instance within its container to start or terminate the VM.

### Scripts

 * `cluster/kubectl.sh`: This is a wrapper around Kubernetes' kubectl command so that it can be run directly from this checkout without logging into a node.
 * `cluster/virtctl.sh` is a wrapper around `virtctl`. `virtctl` brings all virtual machine-specific commands with it. It is a supplement to `kubectl`.
   e.g. `cluster/virtctl.sh console testvm`.
 * `cluster/cli.sh` helps you creating ephemeral Kubernetes and OpenShift
   clusters for testing. This is helpful when direct management or access to
   cluster nodes is necessary. e.g. `cluster/cli.sh ssh node01`.

### Makefile Commands

 * `make cluster-up`: This will deploy a fresh environment, the contents of
   `KUBE_PROVIDER` will be used to determine which provider from the `cluster` directory will be deployed.
 * `make cluster-sync`: After deploying a fresh environment, or after making changes to code in this tree, this command will sync the Pods and DaemonSets in the running KubeVirt environment with the state of this tree.
 * `make cluster-down`: This will tear down a running KubeVirt environment.
