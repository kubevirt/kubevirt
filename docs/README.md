## Technical Overview

Kubernetes allows for extensions to its architecture in the form of custom
resources: <https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/extend-kubernetes/api-extension/custom-resources/>.
KubeVirt represents virtual machines as custom resources and manages changes
to libvirt domains based on the state of those resources.

### Project Components

 * virt-api: This component provides a HTTP RESTful entrypoint to manage
   the virtual machines within the cluster.
 * virt-controller: This component manages the state of each VMI within the
   Kubernetes cluster.
 * virt-handler: This is a daemon that runs on each Kubernetes node. It is
   responsible for monitoring the state of VMIs according to Kubernetes and
   ensuring the corresponding libvirt domain is booted or halted accordingly.
 * virt-launcher: This component is a place-holder, one per running VMI. It
   contains the running VMI and remains running as long as the VMI is defined.

### Scripts

 * `cluster/kubectl.sh`: This is a wrapper around Kubernetes' kubectl command so
   that it can be run directly from this checkout without logging into a node.
 * `cluster/virtctl.sh` is a wrapper around `virtctl`. `virtctl` brings all
   virtual machine specific commands with it. It is supplement to `kubectl`.
   e.g. `cluster/virtctl.sh console testvm`.
 * `cluster/cli.sh` helps you creating ephemeral kubernetes and openshift
   clusters for testing. This is helpful when direct management or access to
   cluster nodes is necessary. e.g. `cluster/cli.sh ssh node01`.

### Makefile Commands

 * `make cluster-up`: This will deploy a fresh environment, the contents of
   `KUBE_PROVIDER` will be used to determine which provider from the `cluster`
   directory will be deployed.
 * `make cluster-sync`: After deploying a fresh environment, or after making
   changes to code in this tree, this command will sync the Pods and DaemonSets
   in the running KubeVirt environment with the state of this tree.
   Note: Use make cluster-sync PARALLEL_CLEANUP=1, for a faster deploy.
   Usable for healthy clusters and for first deploy only.
   It will skip cleaning in case kubevirt namespace doesnt exists, and if
   it does exists, it will run the cluster-clean in parallel to the cluster-build,
   once both are finished it would run cluster-deploy.
 * `make cluster-down`: This will tear down a running KubeVirt enviornment.
