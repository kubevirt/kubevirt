# KubeVirt metrics
This document aims to help users that are not familiar with all metrics exposed by different KubeVirt components.
All metrics documented here are auto-generated by the utility tool `tools/doc-generator` and reflects exactly what is being exposed.

## Developing new metrics
After developing new metrics or changing old ones, please run `make generate` to regenerate this document.

If you feel that the new metric doesn't follow these rules, please change `doc-generator` with your needs.
