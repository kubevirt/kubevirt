                       https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Recommended_configurations The profiles are intent based, so they may change over time as new ciphers are developed and existing ciphers are found to be insecure.  Depending on precisely which ciphers are available to a process, the list may be reduced.
                       Note that the Modern profile is currently not supported because it is not yet well adopted by common software libraries.

                       https://wiki.mozilla.org/Security/Server_Side_TLS#Recommended_configurations The profiles are intent based, so they may change over time as new ciphers are developed and existing ciphers are found to be insecure.  Depending on precisely which ciphers are available to a process, the list may be reduced.
                       Note that the Modern profile is currently not supported because it is not yet well adopted by common software libraries.
