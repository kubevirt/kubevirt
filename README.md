**KubeVirt** is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes.
The aim is to provide a common ground for virtualization solutions on top of
Kubernetes.

**Note:** KubeVirt is a heavy work in progress.

# Introduction

## Virtualization extension for Kubernetes

At it's core KubeVirt extends [Kubernetes][k8s] by adding
additional virtualization resource types (especially the `VM` type) through
[Kubernetes's third party resource concept][tpr].
By using this mechanism, the Kubernetes API can be used to manage these `VM`
resources alongside all other resources Kubernetes provides.

The resources themselves are not enough to launch virtual machines.
For this to happen the _functionality and business logic_ needs to be added to
the cluster. The functionality is not added to Kubernetes itself, but rather
added to a Kubernetes cluster by _running_ additional controllers and agents
on an existing cluster.

The necessary controllers and agents are provided by KubeVirt.

As of today KubeVirt can be used to declarative

 * Create a predefined VM
 * Schedule a VM on a Kubernetes cluster
 * Launch a VM
 * Stop a VM
 * Delete a VM

# Getting Started

**Demo** To try out our demo run
```bash
$ curl run.kubevirt.io/demo.sh | bash
```
on a recent Fedora or Ubuntu and follow [these steps](https://github.com/kubevirt/demo).

**Developer** To set up a development environment please read our
[Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md).
