**KubeVirt** is a virtual machine management add-on for Kubernetes.
The aim is to provide a common ground for virtualization solutions on top of
Kubernetes.

**Note:** KubeVirt is a heavy work in progress.

# Introduction

## Virtualization extension for Kubernetes

At its core, KubeVirt extends [Kubernetes][k8s] by adding
additional virtualization resource types (especially the `VM` type) through
[Kubernetes's Custom Resource Definitions API][crd].
By using this mechanism, the Kubernetes API can be used to manage these `VM`
resources alongside all other resources Kubernetes provides.

The resources themselves are not enough to launch virtual machines.
For this to happen the _functionality and business logic_ needs to be added to
the cluster. The functionality is not added to Kubernetes itself, but rather
added to a Kubernetes cluster by _running_ additional controllers and agents
on an existing cluster.

The necessary controllers and agents are provided by KubeVirt.

As of today KubeVirt can be used to declaratively

 * Create a predefined VM
 * Schedule a VM on a Kubernetes cluster
 * Launch a VM
 * Stop a VM
 * Delete a VM

# To start using KubeVirt

Try our quickstart at [kubevirt.io](http://kubevirt.io/get_kubevirt/).

See our user documentation at [docs.kubevirt.io](http://docs.kubevirt.io/).

# To start developing KubeVirt

To set up a development environment please read our
[Getting Started Guide](docs/getting-started.md). To learn how to contribute, please read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).

You can learn more about how KubeVirt is designed (and why it is that way),
and learn more about the major components by taking a look at
[our developer documentation](docs/):

 * [Architecture](docs/architecture.md) - High-level view on the architecture
 * [Components](docs/components.md) - Detailed look at all components
 * [API Reference](https://www.kubevirt.io/api-reference/)


# Community

of options:

* Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/kubevirt)
* Chat with us on IRC via [#kubevirt @ irc.freenode.net](https://kiwiirc.com/client/irc.freenode.net/kubevirt)
* Discuss with us on the [kubevirt-dev Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/kubevirt-dev)
* Stay informed about designs and upcoming events by watching our [community content](https://github.com/kubevirt/community/)

## Submitting patches

When sending patches to the project, the submitter is required to certify that
they have the legal right to submit the code. This is achieved by adding a line

    Signed-off-by: Real Name <email@address.com>

to the bottom of every commit message. Existence of such a line certifies
that the submitter has complied with the Developer's Certificate of Origin 1.1,
(as defined in the file docs/developer-certificate-of-origin).

This line can be automatically added to a commit in the correct format, by
using the '-s' option to 'git commit'.
