# KubeVirt Adopters

This is a likely incomplete list of KubeVirt adopters - end-users and distributors alike.

| User | Since | Use-Case |
|-|-|:-|
| Red Hat | 2016 | As a distributor we are building OpenShift Virtualization on KubeVirt in order to enable VM workloads and -flows on Kubernetes. |
| [Kubermatic](https://kubermatic.com) | 2019 | As a distributor we are running KubeVirt to enable VM workload on Kubermatic Virtualization. Follow the [link](https://www.kubermatic.com/products/kubevirt/) for more information. |
| H3C | 2019 | We distribute KubeVirt as part of CloudOS to enable VM workloads on Kubernetes at customer sites .

| NVIDIA | 2018 | NVIDIA's latest computing platform is built on open-source projects like Kubernetes and KubeVirt to power products like [GeForce NOW](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/) with more to come.
| [CoreWeave](https://www.coreweave.com) | 2020 | A Kubernetes native cloud provider with focus on GPUs at scale. KubeVirt allows us to co-locate non-containerizable workloads such as Virtual Desktops next to compute intensive containers executing on bare metal. All orchestrated via the Kubernetes API leveraging the same network policies and persistent volumes for both VM and containerized workloads. |
| [Civo](https://www.civo.com) | 2020 | We are using KubeVirt as part of our stack to enable tenant cluster provisioning within Civo cloud. |
| [SUSE](https://www.suse.com/) | 2020 | SUSE believes KubeVirt is the best open source way to handle Virtual Machines on Kubernetes today. We offer this additional possibility to our customers by leveraging KubeVirt in our products. |
| [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/) | 2018 | Cloudflare uses KubeVirt within its core data centers to accommodate use cases of our teams that are less container friendly, such as our CI runners, while still taking advantage of the Kubernetes environment. |
