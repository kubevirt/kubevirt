                any object from a non-empty API group (non core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim
                object. When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed
                if the type of the specified object matches some installed volume
                populator or dynamic provisioner. This field will replace the functionality
                of the dataSource field and as such if both fields are non-empty,
                they must have the same value. For backwards compatibility, when namespace
                isn''t specified in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef)
                will be set to the same value automatically if one of them is empty
                and the other is non-empty. When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                dataSource isn''t set to the same value and must be empty. There are
                three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef   allows
                any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects. * While
                dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef   preserves
                all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is   specified.
                * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows
                objects   in any namespaces. (Beta) Using this field requires the
                AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled. (Alpha) Using the
                namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource
                feature gate to be enabled.'

                          objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping
                          them), dataSourceRef   preserves all values, and generates
                          an error if a disallowed value is   specified. * While dataSource
                          only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects   in
                          any namespaces. (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource
                          feature gate to be enabled. (Alpha) Using the namespace

                          new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                          because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled

                  For example, in a 3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 1, and pods
                  with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/1: In this case, the global

                  as 0, and then the calculation of Skew is performed. And when the
                  number of eligible domains with matching topology keys equals or
                  greater than minDomains, this value has no effect on scheduling.
                  As a result, when the number of eligible domains is less than minDomains,
                  scheduler won't schedule more than maxSkew Pods to those domains.
                  If value is nil, the constraint behaves as if MinDomains is equal
                  to 1. Valid values are integers greater than 0. When value is not

                  pods with the same labelSelector spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2
                  | zone3 | |  P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number of domains is less
                  than 5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\" is treated as 0. In this
                  situation, new pod with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,

                  an eligible domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements
                  of nodeAffinityPolicy and nodeTaintsPolicy. e.g. If TopologyKey
                  is "kubernetes.io/hostname", each Node is a domain of that topology.
                  And, if TopologyKey is "topology.kubernetes.io/zone", each zone
                  is a domain of that topology. It's a required field.

                                  backwards compatibility, when namespace isn''t specified
                                  in dataSourceRef, both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef)

                                  isn''t set to the same value and must be empty.
                                  There are three important differences between dataSource
                                  and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                  two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef   allows
                                  any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                  objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed values
                                  (dropping them), dataSourceRef   preserves all values,
                                  and generates an error if a disallowed value is   specified.
                                  * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef
                                  allows objects   in any namespaces. (Beta) Using

                                  to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector spread
                                  as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |  P P  |  P
                                  P  |  P P  | The number of domains is less than
                                  5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\" is treated
                                  as 0. In this situation, new pod with the same labelSelector
                                  cannot be scheduled, because computed skew will
                                  be 3(3 - 0) if new Pod is scheduled to any of the
                                  three zones, it will violate MaxSkew. \n This is

                                      object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object. When
                                      this field is specified, volume binding will
                                      only succeed if the type of the specified object
                                      matches some installed volume populator or dynamic
                                      provisioner. This field will replace the functionality
                                      of the dataSource field and as such if both
                                      fields are non-empty, they must have the same
                                      value. For backwards compatibility, when namespace
                                      isn''t specified in dataSourceRef, both fields
                                      (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to
                                      the same value automatically if one of them
                                      is empty and the other is non-empty. When namespace
                                      is specified in dataSourceRef, dataSource isn''t
                                      set to the same value and must be empty. There
                                      are three important differences between dataSource
                                      and dataSourceRef: * While dataSource only allows
                                      two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef   allows
                                      any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                      objects. * While dataSource ignores disallowed
                                      values (dropping them), dataSourceRef   preserves
                                      all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                      value is   specified. * While dataSource only
                                      allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects   in
                                      any namespaces. (Beta) Using this field requires
                                      the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                                      two important differences between DataSource
                                      and DataSourceRef: * While DataSource only allows
                                      two specific types of objects, DataSourceRef
                                      allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim
                                      objects. * While DataSource ignores disallowed
                                      values (dropping them), DataSourceRef preserves
                                      all values, and generates an error if a disallowed
                                      value is specified. (Beta) Using this field
                                      requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate

                                      3-zone cluster, MaxSkew is set to 2, MinDomains
                                      is set to 5 and pods with the same labelSelector
                                      spread as 2/2/2: | zone1 | zone2 | zone3 | |
                                      \ P P  |  P P  |  P P  | The number of domains
                                      is less than 5(MinDomains), so \"global minimum\"
                                      is treated as 0. In this situation, new pod
                                      with the same labelSelector cannot be scheduled,
                                      because computed skew will be 3(3 - 0) if new
                                      Pod is scheduled to any of the three zones,
                                      it will violate MaxSkew. \n This is a beta field
                                      and requires the MinDomainsInPodTopologySpread

                                      We consider each <key, value> as a "bucket",

                                      domain as a domain whose nodes meet the requirements

                                      A constraint is considered "Unsatisfiable" for

                          them), dataSourceRef   preserves all values, and generates
                          an error if a disallowed value is   specified. * While dataSource
                          only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects   in
                          any namespaces. (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource
