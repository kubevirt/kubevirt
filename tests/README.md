# Integration tests

## Writing e2e tests

We aim to run e2e tests in parallel by default. As such the following rules should be followed:
 * Use cirros and alpine VMs for testing wherever possible. If you have to
   use another OS, discuss on the PR why it is needed.
 * Stay within the boundary of the Testnamespaces which we prove. If you have
   to create resources outside the test namespaces, discuss potential
   solutions on such a PR.
 * If you really have to run tests serial (destructive tests, infra-tests,
  ...), add the [Serial decorator](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#serial-specs) to the test.
 * If tests are not using the default cleanup code, additional custom
   preparations may be necessary.

Additional suggestions:

 * The `[Disruptive]` tag is recognized by the test suite but is not yet
   mandatory. Feel free to set it on destructive tests.
 * Conformance tests need to be marked with a `[Conformance]` tag.
 * We try to mark tests that require advanced/special storage capabilities with `[storage-req]`,  
   So they are easy to skip when lanes with new storage solutions are introduced.  
   At the point of writing this we use `rook-ceph-block` which certainly qualifies for running them.

## Test Namespaces

If tests are executed in parallel, every test gets its unique set of namespaces
to test in. If you write a test and reference the namespaces
`test.NamespaceTestDefault`, `test.NamespaceTestAlternative` or
`tests.NamespaceTestOperator`, you get different values, based on the ginkgo
execution node.

For as long as test resources are created by referencing these namespaces,
there is no test conflict to expect.

## Running integration tests

Integration tests require a running Kubevirt cluster.  Once you have a running
Kubevirt cluster, you can use the `-master` and the `-kubeconfig` flags to
point the tests to the cluster.

## Running networking tests for outside connectivity

When running the tests with no internet connection,
some networking tests ,that test outside connectivity, might fail,
and you might want to skip them.
For that some additional flags are needed to be passed.
In addition, if you'd like to test outside connectivity
using different addresses than the default
(`8.8.8.8`, `2001:db8:1::1` and `google.com`), you can achive that with the 
designated flags as well.

For each method detailed below, there is note about the needed flags
to the outside connectivity tests and how to pass them.

## Run them on an arbitrary KubeVirt installation

```
cd tests # from the git repo root folder
go test -kubeconfig=path/to/my/config -config=default-config.json
```

>**outside connectivity tests:** The tests will run by default.
>To skip the outside connectivity tests add
>`-ginkgo.skip='\[outside_connectivity\]'` To your go command.
>To change the IPV4, IPV6 or DNS used for outside connectivity tests,
>add `conn-check-ipv4-address`,
>`conn-check-ipv6-address` or `conn-check-dns` to your go command,
>with the desired value.
>For example:
>```
>go test -kubeconfig=$KUBECONFIG -config=default-config.json \
>-conn-check-ipv4-address=8.8.4.4 -conn-check-ipv6-address=2620:119:35::35 \
>-conn-check-dns=amazon.com \
>```


## Run them on one of the core KubeVirt providers

There is a make target to run this with the config
taken from hack/config.sh:

```
# from the git repo root folder
make functest
```

>**outside connectivity tests:** The tests will run by default. To skip
>the tests export `KUBEVIRT_E2E_SKIP='\[outside_connectivity\]'` 
>environment variable before running the tests.
>To change the IPV4, IPV6 or DNS used for outside connectivity tests,
>you can export `CONN_CHECK_IPV4_ADDRESS`, `CONN_CHECK_IPV6_ADDRESS` and  
> `CONN_CHECK_DNS` with the desired values. For example:
>```
>export CONN_CHECK_IPV4_ADDRESS=8.8.4.4
>export CONN_CHECK_IPV6_ADDRESS=2620:119:35::35
>export CONN_CHECK_DNS=amazon.com
>```

## Run them anywhere inside of container

```
# Create directory for data / results / kubectl binary
mkdir -p /tmp/kubevirt-tests-data
# Make sure that eveybody can write there
setfacl -m d:o:rwx /tmp/kubevirt-tests-data
setfacl -m o:rwx /tmp/kubevirt-tests-data

docker run \
    -v /tmp/kubevirt-tests-data:/home/kubevirt-tests/data:rw,z --rm \
    kubevirt/tests:latest \
        --kubeconfig=data/openshift-master.kubeconfig \
        --container-tag=latest \
        --container-prefix=quay.io/kubevirt \
        --test.timeout 180m \
        --junit-output=data/results/junit.xml \
        --deploy-testing-infra \
        --path-to-testing-infra-manifests=data/manifests
```

## Skipping tests when cluster requirements aren't met
KubeVirt provides [tests decorators](https://github.com/kubevirt/kubevirt/blob/main/tests/decorators/decorators.go)
to indicate the cluster requirements for certain tests. If your
cluster doesn't meet these requirements, you can choose to skip
the relevant tests by explicitly setting the `KUBEVIRT_E2E_SKIP`
environment variable with the appropriate decorators.

For example, to skip tests that require more than one schedulable node,
which is useful for single-node clusters, run:

``` bash
export KUBEVIRT_E2E_SKIP=requires-two-schedulable-nodes
```

The `KUBEVIRT_E2E_SKIP` variable supports regular expressions.
For example, to skip tests requiring two schedulable nodes
and specific storage, run:

``` bash
export KUBEVIRT_E2E_SKIP=requires-two-schedulable-nodes|storage-req
```

For more information on filtering tests when using Ginkgo directly,
refer to [Ginkgo documentation](https://onsi.github.io/ginkgo/#description-based-filtering).

## Filtering tests by labels
You can filter tests by labels using the `KUBEVIRT_LABEL_FILTER`
environment variable. This variable allows you to specify labels
that tests must have to be executed.  
For example, to run only tests with the Conformance label, run:

``` bash
export KUBEVIRT_LABEL_FILTER=Conformance
```

The `KUBEVIRT_LABEL_FILTER` variable supports regular expressions.

## Focusing on specific tests
To focus on specific tests, you can use the `KUBEVIRT_E2E_FOCUS`
environment variable. This variable supports regular expressions
to match the test descriptions.  
For example, to run only tests related to networking, run:

``` bash  
export KUBEVIRT_E2E_FOCUS=networking
```  

The `KUBEVIRT_LABEL_FILTER` variable supports regular expressions.
