# Integration tests

## Writing e2e tests

We aim to run e2e tests in parallel by default. As such the following rules should be followed:
 * Use cirros and alpine VMs for testing wherever possible. If you have to use
   use another OS, discuss on the PR why it is needed.
 * Stay within the boundary of the testnamespaces which we prove. If you have
   to create resources outside of the test namespaces, discuss potential
   solutions on such a PR.
 * If you really have to run tests serial (destructive tests, infra-tests,
  ...), mark the test with a `[Serial]` tag.
 * If tests are not using the default cleanup code, additional custom
   preparations may be necessary.

The following types of tests need to be marked as `[Serial]` right now:

 * Tests which use PVCs or DataVolumes (parallelizing these is on the way).
 * Tests which use Fedora or a lot of memory for other reasons.
 * Tests which use `BeforeAll`.

Additional suggestions:

 * The `[Disruptive]` tag is recognized by the test suite but is not yet
   mandatory. Feel free to set it on destructive tests.
 * Conformance tests need to be marked with a `[Conformance]` tag.

## Test Namespaces

If tests are executed in parallel, every test gets its unique set of namespaces
to test in. If you write a test and reference the namespaces
`test.NamespaceTestDefault`, `test.NamespaceTestAlternative` or
`tests.NamespaceTestOperator`, you get different values, based on the ginkgo
execution node.

For as long as test resources are created by referencing these namespaces,
there is no test conflict to expect.

## Running integration tests

Integration tests require a running Kubevirt cluster.  Once you have a running
Kubevirt cluster, you can use the `-master` and the `-kubeconfig` flags to
point the tests to the cluster.

## Run them on an arbitrary KubeVirt installation

```
cd tests # from the git repo root folder
go test -kubeconfig=path/to/my/config -config=default-config.json
```

## Run them on one of the core KubeVirt providers

There is a make target to run this with the config
taken from hack/config.sh:

```
# from the git repo root folder
make functest
```

## Run them anywhere inside of container

```
# Create directory for data / results / kubectl binary
mkdir -p /tmp/kubevirt-tests-data
# Make sure that eveybody can write there
setfacl -m d:o:rwx /tmp/kubevirt-tests-data
setfacl -m o:rwx /tmp/kubevirt-tests-data

docker run \
    -v /tmp/kubevirt-tests-data:/home/kubevirt-tests/data:rw,z --rm \
    kubevirt/tests:latest \
        --kubeconfig=data/openshift-master.kubeconfig \
        --container-tag=latest \
        --container-prefix=docker.io/kubevirt \
        --test.timeout 180m \
        --junit-output=data/results/junit.xml \
        --deploy-testing-infra \
        --path-to-testing-infra-manifests=data/manifests
```
