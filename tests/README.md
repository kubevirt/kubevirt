= Integration tests =

Integration tests require a running Kubevirt cluster.  Once you have a running
Kubevirt cluster, you can use the `-master` and the `-kubeconfig` flags to
point the tests to the cluster.

== Run them on Vagrant ==

# FIXME: this is not true anymore. haproxy has been removed. what effect does
# that have on the usage of -master
The vagrant environment has an unprotected haproxy in front of the apiserver,
so only `-master` needs to be set to run the tests.

```
cd tests # from the git repo root folder
go test -master=http://192.168.200.2:8184
```

There is a make target to run this with the config
taken from hack/config.sh:

```
# from the git repo root folder
make functest
```
